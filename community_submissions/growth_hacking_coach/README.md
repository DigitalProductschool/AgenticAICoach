```

The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000

- Mobile-friendly responsive layout

### API Endpoint

- **POST /query**: Send a message to the Growth Hacking Coach

#### API Request Format

The API accepts a JSON payload with the following structure:

```json
{
  "message": "Your question or message here",
  "conversation_history": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Previous user message"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Previous assistant response"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `conversation_history` field is optional and allows you to provide context from previous interactions.

### Example API Request

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/query" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Hi! I'm building an AI tool that helps researchers quickly summarize academic papers. We have a basic version out, but user acquisition is really slow."
  }'
```

### Example API Response

```json
{
  "response": "Hi there! Thanks for sharing about your AI research paper summarizer tool. Slow initial user acquisition is a common challenge, especially for specialized tools like yours.\n\nTo help you better, I'd like to understand a bit more about your current situation:\n\n1. Who is your primary target audience? (PhD students, professors, research institutions, etc.)\n2. How are you currently trying to reach potential users?\n3. What's your budget situation for marketing efforts?\n\nIn the meantime, here are two quick experiments you might consider:\n\n1. **Academic Forum Engagement**: Identify 3-5 subreddits, Discord servers, or other online communities where your target users discuss research challenges. Participate genuinely in conversations and mention your tool when relevant to someone's specific problem.\n\n2. **Professor Outreach Campaign**: Create a personalized email template and reach out to 10-15 professors who teach research methods courses. Offer them and their students free access in exchange for feedback.\n\nLet me know more details about your situation, and I can provide more tailored strategies!"
}
```

The coach will analyze your message and provide guidance. If more information is needed, the coach will ask follow-up questions.

## Architecture

This project uses CrewAI to orchestrate a team of specialized AI agents that work together to provide comprehensive growth hacking guidance through a conversational interface:

- **Lead Growth Coach**: Orchestrates the conversation and synthesizes expert advice
- **Channel Specialist**: Identifies high-impact marketing channels
- **Viral Mechanics Designer**: Creates viral growth mechanics and referral programs
- **Content & Automation Guru**: Develops content strategies and automation approaches
- **Growth Analytics Expert**: Provides guidance on metrics and data-driven iteration

The system follows a conversational flow where:
1. The Lead Coach processes the user's message and determines which specialists to consult
2. Relevant specialists analyze the query and provide their expert input
3. The Lead Coach synthesizes this input into a cohesive, conversational response
4. If more information is needed, the Lead Coach will ask follow-up questions
