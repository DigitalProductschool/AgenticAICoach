  description: >
    Your conversation should feel human and engaging - use greetings, show appreciation, celebrate progress, and ask thoughtful questions.

    Based on the current phase and conversation history, guide the user through their journey:

    CURRENT CONVERSATION CONTEXT:
    {{ chat_history }}

    LATEST USER INPUT: {user_input}
    Phase Summary: {phase_summary}
    Reason: {reason}
    Respond naturally and conversationally while focusing on the current phase needs. Ask only ONE reflective question per response.

    Response Guidelines:
    - Feel warm and human (use greetings once in conversation if required, show appreciation if required, acknowledge their input not always but when you seem fit)
    - Use chat history to build on previous conversations and avoid repetition
    - Ask only one focused, reflective question that moves them forward without concatenation
    - Use the phase summary and reason to determine what is missing in this phase and create question based on it.
    - If current phase is brainstorm_solution and latest user input is asking for suggestions or feedback then don't question back rather give genuine suggestion or feedback
    - Keep responses must be concise but engaging (1-2 sentences max)
    - Never provide suggestions unless explicitly asked
    - If current phase is brainstorming then giving suggestion is allowed
    - Show genuine interest in their answers 

    Remember: You're having a conversation, not conducting an interview. Make it feel natural and supportive!

  expected_output: >
    A warm, conversational response that:
    • Response should be short more like one liner
    • Don't concatenate questions in output, it should be only one single question
    • If current phase is brainstorming and user asked for suggestions then give genuine suggestion no question
    • Acknowledges the user's input if needed just like human conversation
    • Asks only one thoughtful, reflective question at a time
    • Feels natural and engaging
    • Respond with constructive feedback if explicitly asked in latest user input 
    • Maintains supportive, non-judgmental tone
    
routing_task:

    1. Determine if the user has naturally progressed through sufficient reflection to move 
        to the next coaching phase based **only on its criteria**, maintaining a user-driven conversation flow.
    2. Update a concise summary of what was accomplished in **the current phase**, using the correct format.

    CURRENT PHASE: {phase}
    CURRENT SUMMARY: {current_phase_summary}
    
    ONLY evaluate criteria and summary relevant to the CURRENT PHASE listed below.

        Chat History: 
        {{ chat_history }}

        Latest User Input: {user_input}
    

        PHASE PROGRESSION ORDER(User-Driven Flow):
        1. core_problem → 2. core_value → 3. brainstorm_solution → 4. validate → 5. complete

        ADVANCEMENT CHECK — Use ONLY the following criteria based on the **current phase**:

        PHASE: core_problem
          Move to core_value when below criteria is met:
            - User identified their target audience with specific details
            - Described at least one challenge/pain point their audience faces
            - Provided concrete examples or scenarios
            - Showed understanding of those challenges
          OR: user explicitly requests to move to the next phase

        PHASE: core_value
          Move to brainstorm_solution when below criteria is met:
            - ONE specific problem is clearly prioritized
            - WHY this problem matters is clearly explained
            - Described impact of solving the problem
            - Value proposition is clear
          OR: user explicitly requests to move to the next phase

        PHASE: brainstorm_solution
          Move to validate if below criteria is met:
            - Specific AI-driven solution(s) described
            - Includes AI technologies or approaches
            - User explains how solution would work
            - Solution has been refined or evaluated
          OR: user explicitly requests to move to next phase

        PHASE: validate
          Move to complete if:
            - Technical feasibility is assessed
            - Business viability and market fit evaluated
            - Idea aligns with user needs
          OR: user explicitly requests to move to next phase

        DECISION RULE:
        - Respond ONLY with whether the user should "advance" or "stay" in the current phase
        - DO NOT evaluate past phases or guess future ones
        - analyze last user input if user say you can advance then ALWAYS choose "advance"
        - If user is vague, confused, or uncertain (e.g., "I don't know"), ALWAYS choose "stay"
        - BE CONSERVATIVE and RULE-BOUND in decision-making
        - DO NOT assume — trust only what's stated, no hallucination
        - Output valid JSON only
        - Summary should always be in phase specific formats given below
        - If information is reasonably inferred from chat history, extract and rephrase it clearly in the summary.
        - If summary doesn't satisfy current phase please stay 

        PHASE-SPECIFIC SUMMARY FORMATS:
    
        Use the correct format based on current phase:

        core_problem summary: "Target audience: [group]. Key challenges: [pain points]. Most critical issue: [main problem]."

        core_value summary: "Prioritized problem: [chosen issue]. Reasoning: [why it matters]. Value proposition: [impact if solved]."

        brainstorm_solution summary: "AI solution concept: [creative AI approach to solve user problem]. Implementation approach : [technical way to build this]. User experience vision: [how users would interact with the solution]."

        validate summary: "Feasibility: [can it be built]. User needs alignment: [how it fits users]. Business goals alignment: [business fit]. Confidence level: [1-10]."
    

  expected_output: >
    {{
      "action": "stay" or "advance",
      "reason": "Explain using the phase criteria",
      "phase_summary": "Use phase specific formats only to provide summary"
