## 🚀 Getting Started (Docker)

Running the application with Docker is the recommended method.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running on your system.
- An OpenAI API key.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abdulmunimjemal/AgenticAICoach
    cd AgenticAICoach/community_submissions/cv_reviewer/
    ```

2.  **Create Environment File**
    Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory. Add your OpenAI API key to this file:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-YourSecretApiKeyGoesHere
    MODEL=gpt-4O
    ```

    You can find a `.env.example` for this

3.  **Build and Run with Docker Compose**
    From the root directory, run the following command. This will build the Docker image and start the application.
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```

4.  **Access the Application**
    Once the container is running, open your web browser and navigate to:
    **[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)**
    
    You can check  **[http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)** for API docs.

You can now upload a CV and receive your AI-powered review!

### 💻 Local Development (Without Docker)

If you prefer to run the application locally for development:

1.  **Create a virtual environment and activate it**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Create `.env` File**:
    As described in the Docker setup, create a `.env` file in the root directory with your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

4.  **Run the FastAPI Server**:
    ```bash
    uvicorn src.api:app --reload
    ```

5.  **Access the Application**:
    The application will be available at **[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)**.
