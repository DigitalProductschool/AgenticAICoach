# 🧠 AI Feature Clarity Coach

The **AI Feature Clarity Coach** is an intelligent chat assistant that guides users in refining their AI product ideas through a thoughtful, self-reflective, and supportive conversation. It simulates a coach that helps you uncover user pain points, define value, brainstorm AI solutions, and reflect on feasibility — one clear question at a time.

---

## 📘 Overview

This coach is built to support:
- AI entrepreneurs exploring product–market fit
- Product teams shaping new feature ideas
- Innovators clarifying use cases for AI-driven solutions

Rather than presenting a rigid form or checklist, the coach adapts dynamically. It evaluates what information has already been shared and progresses only when the **user has reached sufficient clarity** for the current phase.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **User-Driven Flow**: No fixed question lists. Each phase proceeds only if the routing agent confirms you’ve provided enough clarity to move forward.
- **One Question at a Time**: Keeps interactions focused and digestible.
- **Phase-Based Conversation**:
  - Identify your **Core User Problem**
  - Clarify the **Core Value Proposition**
  - Brainstorm **AI Solutions**
  - **Validate & Reflect** on alignment and feasibility
- **Encourages Deep Thinking**: Questions are designed to provoke thoughtful reflection — not quick, surface-level answers.
- **Supportive Coaching Style**:
  - Avoids long-winded answers
  - Offers feedback only when asked
  - Uses a non-judgmental, encouraging tone

---
## 🧠 Architecture Overview
- **Routing Agent** (Flow Manager):
Decides whether the user is ready to progress to the next coaching phase based on phase-specific criteria and chat history.

- **Phase-Specific Agents**:
Each phase is handled by a dedicated agent with its own goals and prompts, defined via YAML (agents.yaml, tasks.yaml).
  - core_problem_agent
  - core_value_agent
  - solution_agent
  - validation_agent

- **Routing and State Management**:
Uses CrewAI’s Flow system and @listen, @start, and @router decorators to manage user state, conversation routing, and task delegation dynamically based on current phase and input.

- **YAML-Driven Configurability**:
Agent roles, prompts, and task logic are entirely YAML-configurable, making it easy to update coaching behavior without changing core logic.

- **Frontend**:
Built with Streamlit and backed by FastAPI, the UI enables real-time conversation and context-aware feedback with state persistence and animated assistant responses.

## 🧑‍💼 Agents Overview

| Agent Name           | Role                                                    |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `routing_agent`      | Evaluates current state and decides whether to stay or proceed |
| `core_problem_agent` | Helps uncover the target user and their challenges      |
| `core_value_agent`   | Guides prioritization of the most valuable problem to solve |
| `solution_agent`     | Facilitates creative brainstorming of AI feature ideas  |
| `validation_agent`   | Reflects on feasibility, user fit, and business alignment |

Each phase is initiated **only when the coach determines** that enough reflective insight has been collected.
